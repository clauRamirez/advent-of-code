Wee improvements w/ the goal of practicing
- [] Learn macros and where they could be used to reuse code!
- [] Split lib files between /include (header files) & another one with implementations, what's a sound standard here?
- [] Compatilibity - how to make code more portable?
- [] Unit tests, find most common used ones, pick one and write unit test to practice.
- [] Very last thing but would be great to add a folder for year at root and move days within it, to prep for next year!
- [] Add a little README.md
- [] clang compiler standard gcc (currently /usr/bin/cc hardcoded)
